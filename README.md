### MaxDcb's Github

Hi there, welcome to my private Github repository, where I store my personal work on security related tools.  
I am currently employed as an application pentester. 
I am passionate about malware development and CTF, mostly on HTB.

Take a look at my main project [C2TeamServer](https://github.com/maxDcb/C2TeamServer) which is a C2 framework that I used to clear OSEP ðŸš€.
